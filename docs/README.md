### Goals

TerraFX is aiming to be a cross-platform framework for developing multimedia-
based applications.

* We plan on primarily supporting Linux and Windows and are looking at the
  possibility of supporting MacOS as well.
* We plan on providing an API that abstracts over the various lower-level
  graphics, audio, and windowing libraries APIs and makes them easy to use.

### Languages and Frameworks

TerraFX uses C# as its primary development language and .NET Core as our primary
target framework.
