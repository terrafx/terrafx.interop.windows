      <para>Represents a node of text content in xml.</para>
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      <para>XML has no concept of typed content; all content is textual in nature.  In some cases this is inefficient, requiring
translation between text and natural form (e.g. the characters '1','2','8' and the numerical value 128) or requiring
more bytes of storage for the representation (e.g. the characters '2',5','5' might take 3 bytes, while the numerical
value 255 could only take 1).
This structure provides a way to indicate textual content in xml without physically representing it as the characters
that comprise that value.</para>
