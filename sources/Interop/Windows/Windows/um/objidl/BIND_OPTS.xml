  <member name="BIND_OPTS">
    <summary>
      <para>Contains parameters used during a moniker-binding operation.</para>
      <para>The <see cref="BIND_OPTS2" /> or <see cref="BIND_OPTS3" /> structure can be used in place of the <b>BIND_OPTS</b> structure.</para>
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      <para>A <b>BIND_OPTS</b> structure is stored in a bind context; the same bind context is used by each component of a composite moniker during binding, allowing the same parameters to be passed to all components of a composite moniker. See <see cref="IBindCtx" /> for more information about bind contexts.</para>
      <para>Moniker clients (use a moniker to acquire an interface pointer to an object) typically do not need to specify values for the members of this structure. The <see cref="CreateBindCtx" /> function creates a bind context with the bind options set to default values that are suitable for most situations; the <see cref="BindMoniker" /> function does the same thing when creating a bind context for use in binding a moniker. If you want to modify the values of these bind options, you can do so by passing a <b>BIND_OPTS</b> structure to the <see cref="IBindCtx.SetBindOptions" /> method. Moniker implementers can pass a <b>BIND_OPTS</b> structure to the <see cref="IBindCtx.GetBindOptions" /> method to retrieve the values of these bind options.</para>

    <summary>
      <para>The size of this structure, in bytes.</para>

  <member name="BIND_OPTS.grfFlags">
    <summary>
      <para>Flags that control aspects of moniker binding operations. This value is any combination of the bit flags in the <see cref="BIND_FLAGS" /> enumeration. The <see cref="CreateBindCtx" /> function initializes this member to zero.</para>
    </summary>
  </member>
  <member name="BIND_OPTS.grfMode">
    <summary>
      <para>Flags that should be used when opening the file that contains the object identified by the moniker. Possible values  are the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/Stg/stgm-constants">STGM constants</a>. The binding operation uses these flags in the call to <see cref="IPersistFile.Load" /> when loading the file. If the object is already running, these flags are ignored by the binding operation. The <see cref="CreateBindCtx" /> function initializes this field to STGM_READWRITE.</para>

  <member name="BIND_OPTS.dwTickCountDeadline">
    <summary>
      <para>The clock time by which the caller would like the binding operation to be completed, in milliseconds. This member lets the caller limit the execution time of an operation when speed is of primary importance. A value of zero indicates that there is no deadline. Callers most often use this capability when calling the <see cref="IMoniker.GetTimeOfLastChange" /> method, though it can be usefully applied to other operations as well. The <see cref="CreateBindCtx" /> function initializes this field to zero.</para>
      <para>Typical deadlines allow for a few hundred milliseconds of execution. This deadline is a recommendation, not a requirement; however, operations that exceed their deadline by a large amount may cause delays for the end user. Each moniker implementation should try to complete its operation by the deadline, or fail with the error MK_E_EXCEEDEDDEADLINE.</para>
      <para>If a binding operation exceeds its deadline because one or more objects that it needs are not running, the moniker implementation should register the objects responsible in the bind context using the <see cref="IBindCtx.RegisterObjectParam" />. The objects should be registered under the parameter names "ExceededDeadline", "ExceededDeadline1", "ExceededDeadline2", and so on. If the caller later finds the object in the running object table, the caller can retry the binding operation.</para>
      <para>The <see cref="GetTickCount" /> function indicates the number of milliseconds since system startup, and wraps back to zero after 2^31 milliseconds. Consequently, callers should be careful not to inadvertently pass a zero value (which indicates no deadline), and moniker implementations should be aware of clock wrapping problems.</para>
