    <summary>
      <para>Retrieves the class identifier (CLSID) of the object.</para>
    </summary>
    <param name="pClassID">
      <para>A pointer to the location that receives the CLSID on return. The CLSID is a globally unique identifier (GUID) that uniquely represents an object class that defines the code that can manipulate the object's data.</para>

      <para>If the method succeeds, the return value is S_OK. Otherwise, it is E_FAIL.</para>
    </returns>
    <remarks>
      <para>The <b>GetClassID</b> method retrieves the class identifier (CLSID) for an object, used in later operations to load object-specific code into the caller's context.</para>
      <h3>Notes to Callers</h3>
      <para>A container application might call this method to retrieve the original CLSID of an object that it is treating as a different class. Such a call would be necessary if a user performed an editing operation that required the object to be saved. If the container were to save it using the treat-as CLSID, the original application would no longer be able to edit the object. Typically, in this case, the container calls the <see cref="OleSave" /> helper function, which performs all the necessary steps. For this reason, most container applications have no need to call this method directly.</para>
      <para>The exception would be a container that provides an object handler for certain objects. In particular, a container application should not get an object's CLSID and then use it to retrieve class specific information from the registry. Instead, the container should use <see cref="IOleObject" /> and <see cref="IDataObject" /> interfaces to retrieve such class-specific information directly from the object.</para>
      <h3>Notes to Implementers</h3>
      <para>Typically, implementations of this method simply supply a constant CLSID for an object. If, however, the object's <b><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/com/treatas">TreatAs</a></b> registry key has been set by an application that supports emulation (and so is treating the object as one of a different class), a call to <b>GetClassID</b> must supply the CLSID specified in the <b><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/com/treatas">TreatAs</a></b> key. For more information on emulation, see <see cref="CoTreatAsClass" />.</para>
      <para>When an object is in the running state, the default handler calls an implementation of <b>GetClassID</b> that delegates the call to the implementation in the object. When the object is not running, the default handler instead calls the <see cref="ReadClassStg" /> function to read the CLSID that is saved in the object's storage.</para>
      <para>If you are writing a custom object handler for your object, you might want to simply delegate this method to the default handler implementation (see <see cref="OleCreateDefaultHandler" />).</para>
      <h3>URL Moniker Notes</h3>
      <para>This method returns CLSID_StdURLMoniker.</para>

    <summary>
      <para>Provides the CLSID of an object that can be stored persistently in the system. Allows the object to specify which object handler to use in the client process, as it is used in the default implementation of marshaling.</para>
      <para>
        <b>IPersist</b> is the base interface for three other interfaces: <see cref="IPersistStorage" />, <see cref="IPersistStream" />, and <see cref="IPersistFile" />. Each of these interfaces, therefore, includes the <see cref="GetClassID" /> method, and the appropriate one of these three interfaces is implemented on objects that can be serialized to a storage, a stream, or a file. The methods of these interfaces allow the state of these objects to be saved for later instantiations, and load the object using the saved state. Typically, the persistence interfaces are implemented by an embedded or linked object, and are called by the container application or the default object handler.</para>
