    <summary>
      <para>Contains basic and extended limit information for a job object.</para>
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      <para>The system tracks the value of <b>PeakProcessMemoryUsed</b> and <b>PeakJobMemoryUsed</b> constantly. This allows you know the peak memory usage of each job. You can use this information to establish a memory limit using the <b>JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_PROCESS_MEMORY</b> or <b>JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_JOB_MEMORY</b> value.</para>
      <para>Note that the job memory and process memory limits are very similar in operation, but they are independent. You could set a job-wide limit of 100 MB with a per-process limit of 10 MB. In this scenario, no single process could commit more than 10 MB, and the set of processes associated with a job could never exceed 100 MB.</para>
      <para>To register for notifications  that a job has exceeded its peak memory limit while allowing processes to continue to commit memory, use the <see cref="SetInformationJobObject" /> function with the <b>JobObjectNotificationLimitInformation</b> information class.</para>
