  <member name="STORAGE_DEVICE_DESCRIPTOR">
    <summary>Used in conjunction with the<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/api/winioctl/ni-winioctl-ioctl_storage_query_property">IOCTL_STORAGE_QUERY_PROPERTY</a> control code to retrieve the storage device descriptor data for a device.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="STORAGE_DEVICE_DESCRIPTOR.Version">
    <summary>Contains the size of this structure, in bytes. The value of this member will change as members are added to the structure.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="STORAGE_DEVICE_DESCRIPTOR.Size">
    <summary>Specifies the total size of the descriptor, in bytes, which may include vendor ID, product ID, product revision, device serial number strings and bus-specific data which are appended to the structure.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="STORAGE_DEVICE_DESCRIPTOR.DeviceType">
    <summary>Specifies the device type as defined by the Small Computer Systems Interface (SCSI) specification.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="STORAGE_DEVICE_DESCRIPTOR.DeviceTypeModifier">
    <summary>Specifies the device type modifier, if any, as defined by the SCSI specification. If no device type modifier exists, this member is zero.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="STORAGE_DEVICE_DESCRIPTOR.RemovableMedia">
    <summary>Indicates when <b>TRUE</b> that the device's media (if any) is removable. If the device has no media, this member should be ignored. When <b>FALSE</b> the device's media is not removable.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="STORAGE_DEVICE_DESCRIPTOR.CommandQueueing">
    <summary>Indicates when <b>TRUE</b> that the device supports multiple outstanding commands (SCSI tagged queuing or equivalent). When <b>FALSE</b>, the device does not support SCSI-tagged queuing or the equivalent.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="STORAGE_DEVICE_DESCRIPTOR.VendorIdOffset">
    <summary>Specifies the byte offset from the beginning of the structure to a null-terminated ASCII string that contains the device's vendor ID. If the device has no vendor ID, this member is zero.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="STORAGE_DEVICE_DESCRIPTOR.ProductIdOffset">
    <summary>Specifies the byte offset from the beginning of the structure to a null-terminated ASCII string that contains the device's product ID. If the device has no product ID, this member is zero.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="STORAGE_DEVICE_DESCRIPTOR.ProductRevisionOffset">
    <summary>Specifies the byte offset from the beginning of the structure to a null-terminated ASCII string that contains the device's product revision string. If the device has no product revision string, this member is zero.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="STORAGE_DEVICE_DESCRIPTOR.SerialNumberOffset">
    <summary>Specifies the byte offset from the beginning of the structure to a null-terminated ASCII string that contains the device's serial number. If the device has no serial number, this member is zero.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="STORAGE_DEVICE_DESCRIPTOR.BusType">
    <summary>Specifies an enumerator value of type<see cref="STORAGE_BUS_TYPE" /> that indicates the type of bus to which the device is connected. This should be used to interpret the raw device properties at the end of this structure (if any).</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="STORAGE_DEVICE_DESCRIPTOR.RawPropertiesLength">
    <summary>Indicates the number of bytes of bus-specific data that have been appended to this descriptor.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="STORAGE_DEVICE_DESCRIPTOR.RawDeviceProperties">
    <summary>Contains an array of length one that serves as a place holder for the first byte of the bus specific property data.</summary>
