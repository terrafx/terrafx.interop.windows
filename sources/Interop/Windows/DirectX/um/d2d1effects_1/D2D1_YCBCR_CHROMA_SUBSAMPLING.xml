    <summary>This mode attempts to infer the chroma subsampling from the bounds of the input images. When this option is selected, the smaller plane is upsampled to the size of the larger plane and this effect’s output rectangle is the intersection of the two planes. When using this mode, care should be taken when applying effects to the input planes that change the image bounds, such as the border transform, so that the desired size ratio between the planes is maintained.</summary>

    <summary>The chroma plane is horizontally subsampled by 1/2 and vertically subsampled by 1/2. When this option is selected, the chroma plane is horizontally and vertically upsampled by 2x and this effect's output rectangle is the intersection of the two planes.</summary>
